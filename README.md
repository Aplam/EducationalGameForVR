# EducationalGameForVR
For this project we want to create a collection of educational mini games that will teach people important things in life, such as how to cook, roadside car maintence, and traffic laws. Each of these mini games will have several levels to each of them with each of these levels becoming more difficult for more complex lessons. We also plan to include a flashcard mode where the user may do flashcard drills in order to memorize rules for all the lessons taught. All of this will be in VR, we will be developing for both the oculus rift as well as the vive using Unity and OpenVR/SteamVR. This game's main demographic will mostly be teenagers.
